## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. 
So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, 
and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends 
across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better 
all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, 
and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


- You can observe in the dataset that some of the variables like 'weathersit' and 'season' have values as 1, 2, 3, 4 which have specific labels 
associated with them (as can be seen in the data dictionary). These numeric values associated with the labels may indicate that there is some order to them - 
which is actually not the case (Check the data dictionary and think why). So, it is advisable to convert such feature values into categorical string values 
before proceeding with model building. Please refer the data dictionary to get a better understanding of all the independent variables.
 
You might notice the column 'yr' with two values 0 and 1 indicating the years 2018 and 2019 respectively. 
At the first instinct, you might think it is a good idea to drop this column as it only has two values so it might not be a value-add to the model. 
But in reality, since these bike-sharing systems are slowly gaining popularity, the demand for these bikes is increasing every year proving 
that the column 'yr' might be a good variable for prediction. So think twice before dropping it. 

## Conclusions
- The conclusions from a linear regression analysis can vary depending on the specific dataset and the context of the problem you’re addressing. 
However, here are some general conclusions you might draw from such an analysis:

1. Model Performance
Accuracy: The model’s performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score, 
indicate how well the model fits the data. A lower MSE and a higher R² score generally suggest a better fit.
Predictive Power: The R² score tells you the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. 
For example, an R² score of 0.8 means that 80% of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model.

2. Feature Importance
Significant Predictors: The coefficients of the linear regression model indicate the importance of each feature. 
Features with larger absolute values of coefficients have a more significant impact on the target variable.
Direction of Relationship: The sign of the coefficients (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the relationship between each feature and the target variable. 
A positive coefficient means that as the feature increases, the target variable also increases, and vice versa.

3. Model Assumptions
Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
Independence: The residuals (errors) are independent.
Homoscedasticity: The residuals have constant variance at every level of the independent variable.
Normality: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.

4. Limitations
Overfitting/Underfitting: If the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, it may be overfitting. 
Conversely, if it performs poorly on both, it may be underfitting.
Multicollinearity: If the independent variables are highly correlated with each other, it can affect the stability and interpretation of the coefficients.

5. Practical Implications
Actionable Insights: Based on the model, you can identify key factors that influence the target variable and make informed decisions or recommendations.
Future Work: Suggestions for improving the model, such as collecting more data, trying different features, or using more complex models.

Example Conclusion
## Conclusions
The linear regression model was able to predict the target variable with a mean squared error of {mse} and an R² score of {r2}. 
These results indicate that the model has a [good/moderate/poor] fit to the data. 
The most significant predictors were [feature1], [feature2], and [feature3], with [feature1] having the largest positive impact on the target variable. 
However, the model assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity were [met/not met], suggesting that [potential issues or next steps]. 
Future work could involve exploring more complex models or additional features to improve predictive performance.
